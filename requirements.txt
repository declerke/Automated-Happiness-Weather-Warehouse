# 🏗️ Modern Data Stack Architecture

The project follows a modern "Data Stack" architecture designed for scalability and analytical depth:



---

## ⚙️ The Engine (Python & Core Libraries)
* **Python:** Orchestrates the entire ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process.
* **Pandas:** Handles data cleaning, filtering, and CSV manipulation.
* **Requests:** Manages interactions with the **Open-Meteo** and **Nominatim (Geocoding)** APIs.
* **Psycopg2:** Acts as the high-performance bridge between Python logic and the PostgreSQL database.

---

## 🏛️ The Warehouse (PostgreSQL)


The relational database is organized into a **Star Schema** to ensure efficient data retrieval and clear relational mapping:

### 1. Fact Tables
* Stores numerical "measurements" or quantitative data.
* **Key Metrics:** Temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure.

### 2. Dimension Tables
* Stores the "context" or descriptive attributes.
* **Key Attributes:** City names, country scores, and geographic coordinates.

## 📊 Data Science & Visualization
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Used to generate professional-grade scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps for visual analysis.
* **SciPy:** Utilized for advanced statistical testing, including **Pearson Correlation** and **P-value** calculations to validate data relationships.
